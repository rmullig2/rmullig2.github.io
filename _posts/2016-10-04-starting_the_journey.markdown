Three days into the Flatiron School remote coding bootcamp. I have managed to complete the Introduction to Ruby course and I have become familar with the Learn environment. My observations so far:

1. I have done a fair amount of programming/scripting over the years so learning the Ruby syntax was not too difficult for me.
2. The emphasis on reading the error messages instead of just going back to your code was very helpful. It is a bad habit to try to troubleshoot bugs without listening to the complier.
3. Test driven development has been quite a revelation for me. Taking the extra time to ensure that each step is correct instead of typing in a load of code and then troubleshooting it makes it a lot easier to complete the assignments. After doing this repeatedly it seems like the natural way to code.
4. The staff and community are very responsive. I have asked a few questions and I get a response almost immediately.

My desire to become a professional programmer is mainly about what seems to be the logical progression of my career. I don't feel challenged very often on the IT side. I have a Computer Science background but most of my programming has been done for academic or hobby purposes. I am ready to start making this a full time pursuit.

I'm ready to continue onwards, looking forward to progressing through the course.
