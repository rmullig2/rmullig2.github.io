I have just completed the final portfolio project so it's time wrap up. I will give a few parting thoughts here.

This last project just gave me a sense of the immense amount of material covered in the course. I had to relearn a few things that i had forgotten over the course of the programs. It was great to tie everything together in one project.

The most important thing I take away from the program is the need to continually develop my skills. The more you learn, the more you realize just how much you do not know. I will be looking forward to expaning my coding skills ever further.

The curriculum was very well put together. The pacing was rapid but I found the material to be stimulating and relevant. Hats off to all of the staff at Flatiron for putting together such a high quality program.
