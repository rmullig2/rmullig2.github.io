This project is meant to bring together everything you have learned in the previous lessons. I found it to be a formidable endeavor to go from programming excersices to creating a useful program from scratch. I am finising up the project and will submit it soon so it seems like a good time to review my experience with it.

The first challenge for me was to come up with an appropriate problem that I could solve with a ruby program. I did not want it to be too simple but it could not be too difficult either as I am not quite at the point where I can create a very sophisticated program.

I decided to write a program that will help people who are moving to a new area find nationally ranked high schools. One of the main concerns when people with children (or plan to have children) have when moving is the quality of the schools. My program will allow a person to enter a destinaction zip code (most likely the zip code of the company where they will be working), a radius which will include all of the zip codes within the given range, optionallly specify an income level, and receive a list of schools and rankings within their search radius sorted by rank. If the user inputs an income level then the program will filter out schools within the zip codes which have a greater median income. This allows the user to consider only schools within areas that they can afford to live in. The user can then select one of the schools on the list and retrieve more detailed information.

One of the most important things you learn from creating your own application is the importance of desiign. You really need to think through the object structures and how they relate to each other. The desire to start coding as soon as possible is very strong and difficult to resist but having a good design will save you much more time in the coding and debugging phases than you spend in the design phase.

The skilled use of tools is very important to becoming a professional developer. The RSpec software is used in creating the tests from Test Driven Development. It was used extensively in most of the programming excercises leading up to this project. I found that it is easier to read the RSpec tests than it is to create RSpec tests. RSpec has its own domain specific language in addition to standard Ruby that needs to be mastered for effective usage. I wrote some tests but I am reading some additional material to gain a better understanding of RSpec.

Web scraping is required for this project and it is a very useful skill for the web programmer. I don't find it to bee too abstruce but it does require a certain amount of practice to become skilled. Sometimes web pages don't give the expected output when you reference a series of tags so you may need to try a different method of getting the information.

In summary, I found the project to be a good test of how well you have learned the material. It also gives you an idea of how much more there is to learn so I better get on with finishing it up so I can go to the next section.
