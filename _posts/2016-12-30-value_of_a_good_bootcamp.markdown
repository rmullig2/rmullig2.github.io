There has been a lot of discussion in the press and online about the value of programming bootcamps. I'll use this post to give my thoughts on the subject.

Bootcamps vs Computer Science degrees

I have degrees in Computer Science and I am currently about halfway through the curriculum here at Flatiron. I would say they are two different routes to the same destination. You learn a great amount of theory in a good CS program and use programming languages to implement and demonstrate that theory. However coding is a secondary concern in CS programs so you do not go deeply into the workings of any one particular language. Good bootcamp programs give you a high level of proficiency with the language(s) of choice. You also learn frameworks and development best practices. You do not learn a great deal about CS topics like algorithms so you will need to supplement your learning at some point to acquire that knowledge.

Bootcamps vs Self Study

Mostly all of what is taught in bootcamps can be found either online or in books so why spend the money for a bootcamp? The big difference to me is learning how to properly refactor code. When you write code as an exercise in a book or online course you will typically work on the code until it completes the stated objectives and then file it away permanently. Real production code will updated so it is important to write good code not just code that works. Having experienced developers look at your code and point out better ways to perform the tasks required and which classes should contain which methods is something you cannot get from self study programs. This is what separates the hobbyist programmer from the professional. The ability to write code that can be easily maintained and modified is what companies look for when hiring software developers.

There are many other issues to consider when discussing bootcamps. These were the two that were most important to me when I decided to sign up here. I would suggest to anybody looking to become a developer to consider these points before commiting to a course of action.
