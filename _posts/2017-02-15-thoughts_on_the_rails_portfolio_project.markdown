I am wrapping up the project so this is probably a good time to collect my thoughts on the project and this section of the course. This is a significant milestone so I'm feeling quite good about arriving here.

The Rails section of the course covered an enormous amount of material. Starting with Sinatra was a big help as the transition to Rails was much easier having acquired that knowledge. There are so many different moving parts to understand in order to achieve proficiency. I believe that there is no substitute for dedicating a great deal of time in reading, experimenting, and creating code.

The project I decided upon was to create a web site to allow people to create book reviews and read the reviews of others. At first it seemed like a simple project but once I began creating it, the task grew more complex than I thought.

The major hurdle for me was getting Devise working with Omniauth. It took a lot of digging but eventually I was able to get it to work for both Facebook and LinkedIn. I could have done others but the principal was the same so I decided to move on. Building nested routes also was a bit tricky but with persistence I was able to get through that part as well.

It has been a struggle to make it this far but I feel energized and ready to move forwards. A few finishing touches and  I will be ready to go.
