I just finished the Model Class Methods lab so I think this would be a good time to record my thoughts. This may have been the hardest lab so far. I was fairly familiar with SQL coming into the course so I did not think this would be as difficult as it was. Implementing SQL commands through Active Record is almost like learning an entirely new language. The concepts are similar but the syntax takes a lot of practice before you get the hang of it. I am just happy to have completed the tests so I can continue.

One thing that I have come to appreciate over the time I've spent is the vastness of the Rails framework, There is so much to learn here. You must put in the time to acquire this knowledge, there is no other way. I have spent the entire three day weekend getting through some of these modules. My progress tends to go fast and slow but I make sure I step away when I start to get frustrated. A short break away from the computer can do wonders for the thought process. I didn't think there was any way I could finish this module tonight but after a thirty minute break I came back and realized a moment of clarity.

Tomorrow it is on to the next chapter. Getting closer and closer to the goal.
