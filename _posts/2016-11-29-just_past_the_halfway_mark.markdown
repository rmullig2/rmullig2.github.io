Only about two months ago, I started my journey through the course. At this point, I think it is a good time to take stock and record my thoughts on the experience so far.

The Ruby portion of the course was extensive but thankfully due to my background not overly difficult. There are a few different twists in Ruby that I had not seen before in other programming languages but on the whole the material reviewed and enforced a lot of my previous knowledge.

Git and Githum were topics that I had some familiarity with but not to the extent I have used for this course. I know that it is a vital skill so using extensively in the course is very helpful for your career.

HTML and CSS. I have designed basic websites in the past but never found the exercise all that interesting. The videos were very helpful in taking my knowledge up a notch. Getting the last details fixed in the web sites could be frustrating but is something you need to know how to do.

ORMs and ActiveRecord are new subjects for me. They have required the steepest learning curve but persistence with the material pays off. Being able to tie a web site to a database is the very heart of what it means to be a web developer. The frameworks make this easier but understanding the underlying process is still a necessity.

In summary, my progress has moved in bursts. I have occassionally gotten stuck at certain points in the program. What I have done to get myself going again was backtrack several lessons and review the previous material. It is often the case where I have missed a key concept which created a hole in my knowledge. Once the hole is filled I am able to move on. Looking forward to the second half of the course.
